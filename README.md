## Dotfiles
Here's my collection of dotfiles I use on linux/osx environments.
I continuosly add to this repo over time, as I customise my dev environment.
Feel free to fork this and modify the scripts/dotfiles to suit your own needs!

ZSH and Oh-My-Zsh must be installed:  
- http://ohmyz.sh/   

And the ultimate vimrc is recommended from this repository:  
- https://github.com/amix/vimrc  

### OSX Stuff
Seil: Remap Capslock to esc

Karabiner: Key repeat 400ms 25ms
