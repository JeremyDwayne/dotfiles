## Install
`./install` will run a script that checks what OS you're on, and if you have 
all the necessary programs installed. If you dont, it installs them for you!
Once the dependencies are installed, it will run any third party installations,
and create symlinks for the necessary config files in the correct locations.

## Dotfiles
Here's my collection of dotfiles I use on linux/osx environments.
I continuously add to this repo over time, as I customise my dev environment.
Feel free to fork this and modify the scripts/dotfiles to suit your own needs!

ZSH and Oh-My-Zsh must be installed:
- http://ohmyz.sh/

And the ultimate vimrc is recommended from this repository:
