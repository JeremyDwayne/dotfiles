# File PR

Before filing, check whether a PR for this branch already exists. Review the diff locally against `origin/main` to make sure its contents match the goal.

PR titles usually become commit messages, so follow the repository's title conventions. Look at recently merged PRs and Git history for examples. Prefer a concise human readable title that explains why the change matters.

BAD
> ❌ perf(server): negotiate permessage-deflate on the websocket

GOOD
> ✅ perf(server): cut websocket frame size by 70%+ with gzipping

Open the description with a simple explanation of the problem based on the user's original prompt, then briefly explain the solution. Do not lead with an implementation inventory:

BAD  
> ❌  Removed implicit workspace carry-over from every "new thread" entry point (cmd+n / cmd+shift+o, sidebar v1/v2 buttons, command palette). New threads inherit only the project from context; branch, worktree, and env mode always come from the configured defaults. Deleted buildContextualThreadOptions, startNewThreadInProjectFromContext, and the v1 sidebar's seed-context machinery.

GOOD
> ✅ My "new worktree" default was ignored when starting new threads on existing worktrees. Super unintuitive. Now your preferences always apply.

Open a real PR rather than a draft so review bots run. If the user also asked to babysit it, continue with the `babysit-pr` skill.

Add a blurb to the end of the PR description about what model and harness is making the changes.
